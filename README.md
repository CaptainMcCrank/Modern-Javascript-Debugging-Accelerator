# H1 Modern Javascript Debugging Accelerator
While trying to build an alexa skill with my non-existant Node skills, I discovered that command line tools with interactive debuggers for javascript don't seem to exist.  I was reluctant to build a web page to test node scripts, but apparently that's the only way to do so if I want the power of Chrome devtools' javascript debugger.

## Usage
1. Clone this project.  
2. Copy your .js file into the directory.
3. Modify the onclick event in the html to point to your js file.
4. Fire up a terminal & navigate to the Debugging Accelerator directory.
5. Type python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
6. Use chrome devtools to debug your code. 

what a world.  Is there a better way to do this?
